                  Being one of the most trending topics in science at the
                  moment, Machine Learning evolves from artificial intelligence
                  and study of pattern recognition. With such a rapid growth and
                  large scope, it would be suffice to conclude that this domain
                  is the future of the world. Hence IEEE-VESIT in collaboration
                  with CSI-VESIT conducts a workshop of Machine learning,
